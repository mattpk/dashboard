# dashboard
dead simple page to run on an old android tablet showing weather and other info

It's for my own usecase, so hardcoded for a 1024x600 resolution tablet

## fetch_weather.py
if having the server cache weather instead of the client, run on server

```
chmod +x fetch_weather.py
```

```
nohup ./fetch_weather.py &
```
